		<h6>The Idea</h6>
		<p>One of our favourite elements of Museum in a Box is that you can make a new collection all your own from museums across the world.</p>
		<p>It was often the case, particularly in the late 19th century, that a haul from the New World would be split and shared amongst the grand museums of the UK and Europe. What if you could join them back together?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="nine columns">
		<p>Each group listed here has at least one <a href="/objects">object</a> available to be added to a box.</p>

		<ul>
		<% @institutions.each do |institution| %>
		  <li><%= link_to institution.name, institution %>
		<% end %>
		</ul>
		
		<h5>Building Partnerships</h5>
		<p>It's important to note that this list of organisations is derived from the list of objects we've gathered for version 2. We're working directly with a handful of these good folk, but are very interested to talk with you if you're thinking about 3D digitisation, and interesting projects that share your collection with a broader public than those lucky people who can cross your threshold.</p>
