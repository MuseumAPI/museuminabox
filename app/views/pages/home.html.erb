	<h1>Museum in a Box?</h1>
	<p>It's just what it says on the tin: A museum. In a box.</p>
	
	<h5>Choose your own museum</h5>
	<p>What if you could make your own collection from any of the museums in the world? Get your new collection delivered to your home, classroom or office. </p>
	<h5>Connected museum objects</h5>
	<p>The fun starts when you realise that the box knows what objects are in it, thanks to a "brain" inside it. As well as showing you great content about each object and the collection, what if the brain could look on the web for new info and updates too?</p> 
	<h5>Different boxes, same objects, new knowledge sharing</h5>
	<p>What if a class in Perth is studying with the Mosul in a Box box, and there's a class in Singapore using it too? How could the students interact around the objects and their stories?</p>

	<p>We're on the second round of prototyping. V2 means at least three different boxes, made from a pool of <a href="/objects">about 30 objects</a>.</p>
