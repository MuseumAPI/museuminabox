	<h1>Museum in a Box. Huh?</h1>
	<p>What if you could make your own collection from any of the museums in the world? Imagine if that collection could be delivered to your home, classroom or office. What happens when the box knows what objects are in it? What if it could look on the web for new info about them? <br><br>That's a museum in a box. I know this is too long.</p>
