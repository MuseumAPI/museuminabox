	<h1>The Brain</h1>
	<p>Every box contains a brain. The brain knows which objects are in its box, and can tell you things about them. Each time you ask (by "booping" the object on the brain) the brain makes a note of it. That's called the <a href="/boops">Boop Log</a>.</p>
	<p>Here are some pictures of our early designs...</p>

    <h3>Brain Bits</h3>
    <p>We're still fairly early in the design phase, but our brains are made of:</p>
    <ol>
    	<li>An SD Card</li>
    	<li>A Raspberry Pi II</li>
    	<li>A Wifi dongle</li>
    	<li>An RFID tag reader</li>
    	<li>An RFID interconnector cable</li>
    	<li>Power</li>
    	<li>Some kind of audio output. We've got a few different types of speakers.</li>
    	<li>Some kind of video player, via HDMI out. We're connecting to a projector, and a tablet.</li>
    	<li>RFID tags for all the objects in the box</li>
    </ol>
