The masks are painted yellow and black, and often incorporate feathers, tusks, fur and other natural items. Masked dancers also wear matching costumes. There are several other masked characters in the drama - the workers, the boss, a doctor, deer, hawks and comic figures. A dance master plays the drum and flute."
